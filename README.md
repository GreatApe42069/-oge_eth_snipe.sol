# Doge / ETH Auto Sniper Smart Contract

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the DogeSniper smart contract:

1. **Install Development Environment:** Ensure you have a suitable Ethereum-compatible development environment set up, such as Remix or Truffle.

2. **Deploy the Contract:** Deploy the DogeSniper contract to your chosen blockchain or testnet. Make sure to fund the contract with enough Dogecoin for testing.

3. **Set Target Price:** Use the `setTargetPrice()` function to set the initial target price for sniping.

4. **Implement Sniping Logic:** Customize the `snipe()` function to include your specific sniping strategy. Consider factors like current Dogecoin price, transaction ordering, slippage, and fees.

5. **Test and Deploy:** Thoroughly test the contract in a development environment before deploying it to the live network. Monitor its performance and adjust the sniping strategy as needed.

## Security Considerations

- **Owner Privileges:** Be cautious when assigning the contract owner. The owner has the authority to modify the target price.

- **Sniping Logic:** Ensure your sniping logic is well-designed and considers potential risks such as slippage and transaction ordering.

- **Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing in a development environment to identify and address any vulnerabilities.
